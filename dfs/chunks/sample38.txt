The list of users and groups are both comma separated list of names. The two lists are separated by a space.

Example: user1,user2 group1,group2.

Add a blank at the beginning of the line if only a list of groups is to be provided, equivalently a comman-separated list of users followed by a space or nothing implies only a set of given users.

A special value of * implies that all users are allowed to access the service.

Refreshing Service Level Authorization Configuration
The service-level authorization configuration for the NameNode and JobTracker can be changed without restarting either of the Hadoop master daemons. The cluster administrator can change ${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/hadoop-policy.xml on the master nodes and instruct the NameNode and JobTracker to reload their respective configurations via the -refreshServiceAcl switch to dfsadmin and mradmin commands respectively.

Refresh the service-level authorization configuration for the NameNode:

$ bin/hadoop dfsadmin -refreshServiceAcl

Refresh the service-level authorization configuration for the JobTracker:

$ bin/hadoop mradmin -refreshServiceAcl

Of course, one can use the security.refresh.policy.protocol.acl property in ${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/hadoop-policy.xml to restrict access to the ability to refresh the service-level authorization configuration to certain users/groups.

Examples
Allow only users alice, bob and users in the mapreduce group to submit jobs to the MapReduce cluster:

<property>
     <name>security.job.submission.protocol.acl</name>
     <value>alice,bob mapreduce</value>
</property>
Allow only DataNodes running as the users who belong to the group datanodes to communicate with the NameNode:

<property>
     <name>security.datanode.protocol.acl</name>
     <value>datanodes</value>
</property>
Allow any user to talk to the HDFS cluster as a DFSClient:

<property>
     <name>security.client.protocol.acl</name>
     <value>*</value>
</property>
