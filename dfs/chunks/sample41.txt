Purpose
This document describes how to configure and manage Service Level Authorization for Hadoop.

Prerequisites
Make sure Hadoop is installed, configured and setup correctly. For more information see:

Single Node Setup for first-time users.
Cluster Setup for large, distributed clusters.
Overview
Service Level Authorization is the initial authorization mechanism to ensure clients connecting to a particular Hadoop service have the necessary, pre-configured, permissions and are authorized to access the given service. For example, a MapReduce cluster can use this mechanism to allow a configured list of users/groups to submit jobs.

The ${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/hadoop-policy.xml configuration file is used to define the access control lists for various Hadoop services.

Service Level Authorization is performed much before to other access control checks such as file-permission checks, access control on job queues etc.

Configuration
This section describes how to configure service-level authorization via the configuration file {HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/hadoop-policy.xml.
