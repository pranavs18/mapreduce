Entrepreneurial Initiative: Using iBeacons technology + Cloudlets (smaller Open-Stack instances) to help consumers, to most efficiently find products via optimal indoor navigation. The product maps the online presence of any business via user clicks, likes, interests, re-tweets, visits, profile etc. back to the physical store (using Beacons). This maximizes conversion and create a seamless shopping experience for the end user (when he/she actually visits the physical store). All this goodness while providing real-time analytics to business owners.

I have extensive experience working in R&D and Product development; specifically - Platform/API Development using C#.NET/Java. Owned the inception, implementation and evolution of two core framework engines. Worked on architectural design and implementation of two major proprietary end-user software products.
